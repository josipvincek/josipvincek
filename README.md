## Vision

Engineering decisions in subsurface systems must be transparent, defensible, and computationally structured.

My work focuses on building analytically grounded and reproducible computational frameworks for underground engineering, integrating classical rock mechanics with modern software architecture.

The long-term objective is the development of modular, validation-driven engineering systems that bridge mechanical theory and deployable computational tools.
