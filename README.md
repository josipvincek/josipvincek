## About

I am a Mining Engineer and PhD researcher focused on computational modelling in subsurface engineering. My work integrates analytical stress solutions, rock mass strength criteria, and stability assessment methods into reproducible engineering tools.

I develop scientific and production-oriented software for underground design, wellbore stability, and energy-related subsurface systems. My goal is to bridge rigorous rock mechanics with modern computational workflows and decision-support systems.
