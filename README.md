## About

I am a Mining Engineer and PhD researcher working at the intersection of classical rock mechanics and modern computational engineering.

My research focuses on stress redistribution, rock mass strength modelling, and stability assessment in underground excavations and wellbores. I develop analytically grounded, reproducible computational frameworks that translate mechanical theory into structured engineering decision tools.

The emphasis of my work is transparency: explicit assumptions, deterministic formulations, and validation against numerical models. Rather than relying solely on large-scale finite element simulations, I investigate how closed-form solutions, constitutive rock mass criteria, and strength-to-stress metrics can be integrated into rigorous and computationally efficient workflows.

In parallel, I design modular engineering software architectures for geomechanics and subsurface energy applications, enabling scalable, validated, and reproducible analysis pipelines.

## Publications & Ongoing Work

**A Computational Approach to Preliminary Tunnel Design: Integrating Kirsch Equations and the Generalized Hoek–Brown Criterion**  
*Applied Sciences (2026) – Accepted*

This work presents a transparent analytical framework for coupling elastic stress redistribution with rock mass strength evaluation, including validation against finite-element simulations.

Ongoing PhD research investigates computational models for identifying accident scenarios in underground spaces and optimizing response strategies through structured analytical–numerical integration.

Companion repositories and reproducible examples will be released alongside publications.
